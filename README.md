A calculator to solve the "Knapsack Problem".

"The knapsack problem is the following problem in combinatorial optimization: 
Given a set of items, each with a weight and a value, determine which items to include in the collection so that the total weight is less than or equal to a given limit and the total value is as large as possible."

The user inputs values and the calculator computes the optimal amount of fruit that fit in the weight constraint but also yields the most profit.

Coded in 2022 for a school math project.
